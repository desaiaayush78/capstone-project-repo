# Capstone Project - Fraud Detection Module

## ðŸ“– Overview
This module focuses on building a hybrid fraud detection system by combining Machine Learning (XGBoost) and rule-based risk scoring. The goal is to enhance fraud detection precision and reduce false positives in financial transaction monitoring systems.

## ðŸš€ Key Components
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training using XGBoost classifier
- Rule-based risk scoring based on domain expertise
- Evaluation with metrics like ROC-AUC, Recall, Precision
- Final risk level assignment (High / Medium / Low)

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Used
- IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection Dataset (Kaggle)
- Train and test transactions and identities
- Large-scale transaction data (590K+ records)

## ðŸ“¦ Output
- Fraud prediction CSVs
- Risk scores merged with model outputs
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature importance insights

## ðŸ“¦ Full Datasets

Due to GitHub's 100MB file size limit, the full training and testing datasets are uploaded to Google Drive.
