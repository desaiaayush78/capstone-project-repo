# Capstone Project - Deployment Module

## ðŸ“– Overview
This module demonstrates the deployment of the trained fraud detection model (XGBoost) on unseen new datasets, ensuring real-world applicability for transaction monitoring.

## ðŸš€ Deployment Workflow
- Load the saved XGBoost pickle model
- Preprocess new test datasets to match training structure
- Make real-time predictions (0 = Not Fraud, 1 = Fraud)
- Visualize fraud probability distributions and prediction insights

## ðŸ“Š Key Highlights
- Consistent preprocessing pipeline between train/test
- Fraud vs Non-Fraud distribution analysis
- Key feature analysis for fraud risk understanding

## ðŸ“¦ Output
- Prediction CSV files with fraud probabilities
- Charts showing fraud risk distribution across key features
- Deployment-ready model scripts
